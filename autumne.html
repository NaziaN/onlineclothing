<h2> Autumn Essentials </h2>

<p> I decided to do a little post on my Autumn essentials, any excuse for a flatly eh? 
I feel like such a blogger haha I sort of wish I had a photo of me standing over the items with my legs spread, so sophisticated.
 There are numerous things that spring to mind when I think of Autumn, most of which I have included here. 
 The nights are getting darker and colder and this means more cosy nights in under a blanket watching TV or a classic film like Hocus Pocus with your friends!
 It also means more hot drinks, berry lips and pumpkin spice everything.
 <br>
Around this time of year i have to start looking after my hands a lot more. 
They very easily get dry and start cracking (yummy) so I will always have one in my handbag, one next to my bed and one where I work next to my laptop.
If you can get one that’s sweet cinnamon scented too, you’re in autumnal heaven every time you apply it. 
Autumn also see’s the rise in the number of baths I have. I’m definitely a bath person in the evenings. 
I like to shower in the mornings to wake up and feel fresh,
but I like baths a couple of times a week where I can just soak and relax with different bath fizzers, oils and bubble bath. 
Whilst soaking in the bath it’s nice to burn a candle too. In fact, I burn cosy candles from around the end of August in pure anticipation of the colder months.
Yes, i’m lame. I also have Christmas music playing whilst I type this, judge away (or nod enthusiastically). 
Let’s face it though, there is nothing more pleasing than relaxing with a gorgeously yummy candle flickering away beside you when it’s dark and gloomy outside.

<p> One makeup trend I absolutely love that trickles in around Autumn time, is dark berry toned lips.
 I always think a classic red is good too, maybe even a slighter deeper tone than usual.
 It’s all very vampy and seductive (something i’m not, but I do think I pull off a berry toned lip pretty well, if I say so myself). 
 I have a selection of my favourite lipsticks here that I think are perfect for this time of year.
 A lot of which are a little more on the pricey side, but I’m giving you permission to indulge and treat yourself, because you deserve it *points vigorously*. 
 Tom Ford lipsticks are actually something I’m starting to get a bit obsessed with at the moment and I find my little stash becoming not-so-little.
 This one is called Cherry Red and I feel like it’s a colour that most people should own. It’s gorgeous and it’s classic! 
 Tom Ford lipsticks are also great quality and feel very special. The next one down is my trusty (and a little bit grubby,
 I like to say well-loved) YSL Rouge Pur Couture Matte in 205! This shade is one that I wear all the time. It’s very long lasting and the colour payoff is very good. 
 Love, love, love. Then it’s my beloved Charlotte Tilbury Glastonbury, I don’t need to say much on this because if you know me at all,
 then you’ll know that nine times out of ten, if i’m wearing a berry lip, no, in fact if i’m wearing any lipstick at all, it’s probably this.
 Next is the Burberry lipstick in Oxblood, and yes, you’d be right in saying it looks the exact same as the ones above it, but you can never have too many options!
 Then for my slightly more budget friendly option which is Kiko Intensely Lavish Lipstick in 04. This one is a slightly more pink berry tone, just to add a bit of variation!
 Also a lovely lipstick!
