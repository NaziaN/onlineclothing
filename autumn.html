<h2> Bathroom Must Haves </h2>

<p> Let’s strip it back. Before we get to the clothes, before we even get to the skincare or make up…. 
 let’s talk showers … actually, let’s talk showers AND baths. As you all know I’m a ~huge~ lover of  a good ol’ pamper, 
 and where better to start than scrubbing away in the shower or fizzing it up in the bath…
SO, I thought it would be nice to introduce you to the products that I start my day with – new and old loves, 
these are seven pieces that I couldn’t be without right now!
 <br>
Okay, so let’s forget the whole “save the best for last” right now… this is WAY too exciting for me not to blab about straight away….
Over the next few months I’m going to be teaming up with Herbal Essences to introduce to you their brand *new* Herbal Essences bio:renew range. 
It’s packed full of new scents AND a new formula which is all about helping to bring “dull” hair back to life…HELLO! There are seven new shampoo’s & conditioners, each amazing 
(trust me, I’ve been trying them all!) and each with a beautiful new and different smell! I’ve loved everything about Herbal Essence for as long as I can remember,
they were the first shampoo to make me feel like a “grown up” and I still love them just as much as I did back then…
With so much to show you I thought I’d start with one of my faves… White Grapefruit & Mosa Mint. 
It’s fresh, light, and super summery smelling. I’ve been leaving the conditioner on for an extra five minutes or so and it’s been doing WONDERS. 
My hair is feeling all silky smooth and it means even more singing time in the shower…. Winwin!

<p> So this product is a little off-topic but let me tell you more about why I’ve included it here… 
I’m someone who owns ALL the face masks, but has to constantly remind myself to use them… SOooo recently, to give myself a little nudge,
 I’ve been keeping a different one in the bathroom each week. It means every time I’m in the bath I’m reminded to have a extra little pamper … 
 which is always a good thing! This one is my current fave from Lush, you all know how much I love them. This mask is so natural, so fresh and it works wonder
Sticking with the bath theme I just ~had~ to include these bath rocks.
 They smell INCRED, like seriously amazing…. You really only need a small handful and before you know it your whole bathroom smells like a spa. 
 I’ve only recently discovered all of the Oliver Bonas Bath & Body products and I’m totally hooked. The packaging is BEAUT, they seem to last forever and each range has a really unique scent.
 Love them!
