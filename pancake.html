        <h2> Pancake Galore </h2>
          <p>
		    Pancake day is fast approaching and if any of you have been watching my vlogs recently,
			you'll be aware of the fact I have perfected my American Style Fluffy pancakes courtesy of Jamie Olivers easy to follow recipe! 
			Once you have the pancakes down, the exciting bit is filling, stacking and decorating them so i'm going to show you three ways i've been eating pancakes recently.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		    YOU WILL NEED...
		  <br>
			6 Large Free Range Eggs
			230g Plain Flour
			2 Heaped Teaspoons Baking Powder
			280ml Milk
			2 Pinches Salt
		  <br>
			Separate the egg whites from the yolks and place in separate bowls.
			Whisk egg whites with salt until it has formed stiff peaks (use a hand mixer to save time and your arms). 
			In the other bowl, add sifted flour to egg yolks, followed by baking powder and milk. Beat together until mixed well.
			Fold the egg white mixture into this bowl, being careful not to lose too much air so it stays fluffy and whipped. Using a ladle, 
			spoon the mixture into a non-stick frying pan on a medium to low heat (too hot and the pancakes won't cook properly throughout and will burn in places). 
			I don't use butter or oil, I just make sure my pan is pancake friendly so it won't stick. After a couple of minutes if you notice little bubbles popping to the surface,
			it's about time to flip the pancake. I use a plastic spatula and make sure the pancake has loosened from the pan before flipping. 
			The pancakes should be an even golden colour. I normally place them in a stack on a plate before getting creative with fillings and toppings!

		    I have used so many different recipes over the years for pancakes,
			but this one by Jamie Oliver is definitely the easiest and most effective I’ve ever followed. If you prefer something a little more fluffy as opposed to a crepe, 
			this is perfect for you! I tend to double Jamie’s recipe when i’m making pancake stacks or if we have guests over so I have doubled the recipe above, 
			feel free to half it though if you’re only making them for you or one other person.  
		  <br>
			One of my favourite things about pancakes is the freedom you have with making them all so different. 
			Decorating them is definitely the most exciting part and I feel like you can get your creative skills out. 
			If you have children or younger siblings, you can guarantee this bit will be the most fun. The possibilities are endless,
			you can go slightly more healthy with things like greek yoghurt, honey and fruit or go chocolate crazy with their favourite sweet treats.
