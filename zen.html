	  <h2>Zendaya hits MTV Movie & TV Awards Red Carpet in a plunging sheer gown </h2>
	<p>
	  Zendaya has gone and done it again, schooling us all on the near-impossible when it comes to out-of-the-box style choices.
	  or Sunday night’s MTV Movie and TV Awards, the 20-year-old star stepped onto the red carpet stunning in a chartreuse beaded dress that wowed.
	  A Zuhair Murad creation, Zendaya pulled off one of the hardest colors to wear with ease, proving yet again that she is one of the most stylish girls in Hollywood
	  and can rock any shade of the rainbow. The look was Old Hollywood glamour married with the modern sheer dress trend that has taken over the red carpet as of late.
	  Though fully covered in intricate beading, her look was nearly totally sheer, to be sure.
	  To kick it up a notch, the dress also boasted a down-to-there neckline that proved ultra-flattering on the starlet. 
	  All that said, the feminine ankle-length hemline, flutter sleeves, and all-over embellishment turned it into one of the most elegant looks to hit the carpet tonight.

	  Zendaya is always a risk-taker when it comes to sartorial choices, especially on the red carpet, 
      so we’re thrilled she chose this hard-to-wear hue for tonight’s festivities. 
      Whether it’s a fully beaded evening gown or simply a casual top to pair with jeans, it’s definitely something we’re going to be trying a lot more of this summer.
      MTV is also breaking down gender barriers in its new format, with men and women competing together in the acting categories.
      The show is keeping up its traditional irreverence, though, with awards recognizing the best hero, villain, kiss and duo across television and film. 
      Hosted by actor Adam Devine, the MTV Movie & TV Awards also feature sneak peeks of anticipated films including Transformers: The Last Knight and Spider-Man: Homecoming.
