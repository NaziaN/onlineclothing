      <h2> Gigi looking glamourous as ever at the L'Oreal Premier </h2>
      <p> 
	    They have soared to become some of the biggest names in fashion, after modelling for a huge array of high-profile brands.
		But sister duo Bella and Gigi Hadid both suffered minor wardrobe malfunctions on Monday -
		before regaining composure and dazzling in their usual style on the red carpet of the Glamour Women Of The Year Awards in NYC.
		The brunette, 21, was seen grappling with her assets in her plunging bustier top in front of cameras,
		just moments after sister Gigi, 22, almost took a tumble in her stunning floor length gown outside the venue.  
		Gigi, who was named one of Glamour's Women Of The Year at the bash,
		posed effortlessly for cameras - showing no signs of embarrassment from her near-tumble outside. 
		Leaving her Manhattan apartment ahead of the event, the stunner almost fell flat on her 
		face in front of cameras as she tripped in her expensive Christian Louboutin spiked pumps, selected by stylist Elizabeth Sulcer.
		Luckily, Gigi (born Jelena) managed to steady herself in the Zuhair Murad FW/16 couture champagne-lace,
	and proceeded to burst into a fit of giggles with her sister Bella. 
		Once inside, girls were joined on the red carpet by their mother Yolanda Hadid, who was the picture of style in long black dress that showcased some skin.
