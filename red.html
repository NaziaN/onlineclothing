	     <h2> A Lipstick Lovers Dream</h2>
		   <p>
		      As a self confessed lipstick junkie, can you imagine the joy I felt going through my PO Box when I was met with not just a handful of Clarins Joli Rouge Lipsticks 
			   but a WHOLE DRAW AND MORE-ful of them, my eyes almost popped out my head much like the heart eyes emoji.
			   I wanted to title this blog post “Lipstick Porn” as quite clearly, for any lipstick lover this post would be exciting, 
			   however it turns out that Lipstick Porn is a thing, so that quickly changed. 
		       Clarins isn’t a brand I would normally think to peruse when lipstick shopping as you tend to think of Clarins for their great skincare,
			   however after receiving pretty much their entire lipstick range, I can safely say the lipstick is up there with some of the best and I couldn’t NOT share these with you. 
			   They recently changed their packaging from the previous silver tube to this lovely gold classic metal and I love it!
			   The actual lipstick is very smooth and silky and gives a lovely shine to the lips, 
			   whilst also making them feel hydrated and make wearing the lipstick feel so comfortable.

		      The colour pay off is actually really good, they are marketed as being a sheer lipstick as with many moisturising lipsticks, 
			  colour payoff isn’t usually the highest but I find these very easily build-able to the exact colour of the bullet.
			  Unlike a very matte lipstick which can last you all day with very minimal application, this would require a little more touch ups, 
			  mainly just because of the moisturising properties. 
			  A lot of lipstick lovers ask for my recommendations on slightly more high end lipsticks as there’s always a bit more pressure
			  in making sure you’re getting something of good quality when spending a bit more, whether that’s for you or a gift. I honestly really like these,
			  I think for those of you who like wearing something a little more understated they have such a great choice of nudes and they make your lips look so healthy
			  (something I find a little harder with matte nudes – I much prefer wearing something with shine and moisture). 
			  I was a little apprehensive about the colour payoff of the brighter or deeper shades however as I usually stray more towards a matte as I know it will last well. 
			  I didn’t need to be apprehensive at all, they are just as good as you would have hoped. 
			  If you tend to be a little scared of matte lipsticks or your lips are often on the drier side, I think these lipsticks could be your saviour.
