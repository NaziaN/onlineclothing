        <h2> Let's Talk Jewellery </h2>
		<p>
		  If you follow me on well, any platform really, you will know that I’m really, really into my jewellery.
		  I always have been and after years of picking up pieces here and there, I’ve now got a collection that I absolutely love…Soooo, 
          I thought it would be nice to chat through a couple of my favourite places to buy from – 
          from high street to high end & of course some vintage picks, my collection has aspects of it all! 
        <br>
		  I have a total love//hate relationship when it comes to high street jewellery.
          I love the price tags and the huge selection, but I can’t stand the green finger and brassy finish that forgetting to take your necklace off just once in the shower gives you … so,
          what I’ve decided is to save buying in the high street for when I want something fun and it seems to be working.
          These are usually pieces I wear a little less often, but love just as much. H&M are amazing for all things OOT, 
          remember a little while back when I was non stop wearing these earring. They’re fab if you need to grab a pair of hoops or fancy trying something new but don’t want to spend all the £££ !

		  Another favourite is Topshop (obvs), they have SUCH a good selection and sell everything from delicate stackable rings, 
          to huge over the top dangly pieces that I ~love~ for holidays! Now, if you’re after something a little different, & Other Stories is a must. 
          Their pieces are beautifulllll and although a little pricer, are soso worth it. These are pieces that although they aren’t made out of gold or silver, will last a lifetime!
