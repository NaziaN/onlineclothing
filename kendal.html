	  <h2> Kendal's Perfect Winter Outfit </h2>
	    <p>
		  From reality star to model, Kendall Jenner took the fashion world by storm
		  when she made her catwalk debut in Marc Jacobs's autumn/winter 2014 show at New York Fashion Week.
		  Since then, Jenner has walked for the likes of Balmain,Dolce &amp; Gabbana,
		  Givenchy and Chanel (having become a firm favourite of Karl Lagerfeld),
		  to name only a few, as well as securing a number of high-profile campaigns.
		  But it's not just her modelling jobs that get her noticed, her frequent red-carpet
		  appearances and chic downtime ensembles draw media scrutiny. Chart the elder Jenner sister's style evolution below.

		  Kendall's frock featured a lace up corset detail at the front and a plunging semi-sheer neckline.
		  She teamed her dress with a pair of white boots, oversized hooped silver earrings and a pair of cat's eye sunglasses.
          The star's appearance came after a day out at a star-studded polo match where she wore a stunning green and white floral Dolce & Gabbana dress
		  Kendall told Vogue she was excited to see her first polo game.
		  She said: “Horses have been my first love and passion my entire life.
		  “I think there’s something very therapeutic about being with horses and you can find an amazing bond with them.
		  "I’ve been on a horse since I came out of the womb, basically. I have my horse back home and I see her whenever I can. But I’m actually a first-time polo spectator.”
