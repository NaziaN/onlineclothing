       <h2> How to Maintain Long Healthy Locks</h2>
	     <p> 
		   Are you ready for another ‘how I curl my hair tutorial’? After showing you guys how I do my wavy curls I decided it was time to show 
		   you how I achieve the soft bouncy curls look. So let’s get into it! I will show you every step I take. A
		   Sidenote: I already did a blog post on which heat styling tools I use where I mentioned that the Curling wand I’m using 
		   is from Balance and got it a few years ago. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a link for you to purchase it.
		   Basically, any curling iron that looks like mine I’m using will do. It’s not a wonder tool.
		   My hair was already straightened, but it’s better if you just blow dry you hair especially 
		   for those with straight hair. Also use a hair protectant spray to protect your hair from the heat.
		   For those who have straight hair, make sure to use hairspray on each section and let it dry before you use the curling iron. 
		   If you don’t let it dry it will burn your hair.
		   I sectioned of my hair from my ear down and secured it with a hair tie.
		   Then I take a medium piece of hair and start as close as possible to the roots. 
	       Don't start at the beginning of your roots because it will burn your skin.
		   The reason why you want to start as close as possible to the roots is to get more volume later.
		   Simply wrap your hair around the barrel without twisting it like I showed you at the 'wavy curls' tutorial.

		   Like so. Make sure to wrap your hair making an outside movement. At the 'wavy curls' tutorial 
		   I alternated the direction of each piece of hair to get a more natural look, but it's important to hold on to the same direction in this look.
           I hold the curling want for around 8 seconds and this is how one curl will look. 
           Just keep in mind the longer you hold your hair around the barrel the tighter the curl will be.
		   And if you do it for a few seconds you will get a looser curl. I want to achieve a tighter curl to get the best result in the end. Make sure to not over do it, you don't want your hair to burn.
		   This is how it looks when I curled the sectioned of hair.
		   Now I sectioned my hair of from the highest point of my brow (the curls I already achieved are in the back).
		   I do the same with that section of hair and then I do the upper part. For my bangs I use the same technique but hold it a few second shorter to get a looser curl.
		   This is what you will get when you curled your hair. Now you can keep 
		   it like this if you like it but I like to brush it out to get a more soft bouncy look.
		   It's very important to let you hair cool down before you brush your hair. 
		   The longer you wait the better. For instance. you could do your make-up in the meanwhile.
