	   <h2> Boots of the Season</h2>
         <p> 
		   One thing every woman needs in her fall wardrobe? A sick pair of boots! Here are a few that you’ll
		   turn to again and again that are versatile enough for daywear to evening.
		   Whether you’re into velvet, patent leather or classic suede, one of these pairs will certainly match your personal style.
	       What’s even better? As a Splender member, you’ll receive additional savings with cash back on each purchase.
		   So, now is the time to grab your favorite fall boots!
		   There’s something on this list for every boot lover out there. From a wide range of covetable 
	       and affordable designs in the best colors and styles, any of these boots will have you looking chic and stylish all season.
		   A staple shoe for fall fashion is one that’s chic, trendy and above all else: versatile.
		   For work to weekend let a suede ankle boot be your go-to shoe. An ankle boot in a soft suede texture is always a win for fall.
		   We especially love these Via Spiga Ottavia Booties from Bloomingdales (4% cash back) in this rich brown suede,
		   which is one of the hottest color trends this fall.
		   Also available at Bloomingdales (4% cash back) are these Sam Edelman Edith Suede Booties.
		   Wear them with tights and a mini dress or distressed denim. And these nude Hipstir suede
		   boots from Steve Madden (4% cash back) offer a little country flair with a chic western inspired design and stitch detailing.

		   We probably don’t have to say it—over-the-knee boots are huge this season!
		   Whether flat or heeled, over-the-knee boots lend a sultry vibe to jeans or dresses—not
		   to mention their ability to make your legs look extra sleek and long.
		   These black Odessa Boots from Steve Madden (4% cash back) are like a chic second skin.
		   The soft thigh-high boot is designed to gracefully glide over your leg and complement your look.
		   While these high-heeled Mariah Over-the-Knee Boots from Target (1% cash back) are especially on-trend in this chic gray shade and stacked-heel style.
		   Slip either of these boots over your skinny jeans for an easy running errands weekend
		   look or show them off with a shorter skirt for an alluring effect and playful sixties spirit.
		   Scoop up your pair now—we don’t think this trend will be ending anytime soon!
		   Tougher styles like the motorcycle or combat boot give off an edgier look.
		   They should probably be black and perhaps with a hint of hardware.
		   It’s the perfect weekend boot for running errands around town and will be perfect for combating (see what we did there?) fall and winter weather.
		   This brown pair by Kate Spade from Neiman Marcus (6% cash back) are a break
		   from the conventional black. They exude a nonchalant-chic with a toughened-up exterior, courtesy of wrap-around buckle straps.
